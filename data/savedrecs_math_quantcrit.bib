Abstract = {Our purpose is to proffer QuantCrit methodological approaches to
   interrogate notions of statistical practice by convention. We present
   two approaches to meta-analysis and mean effect size calculations for
   student achievement. The first approach is the conventional approach
   which applies between-group differences to calculate effect sizes
   representing achievement gaps. The second approach is commonly referred
   to as a single-group summary meta-analysis within the medical
   literature, which calculates within-group mean differences referred to
   here as student growth. In the conventional study, 39 independent effect
   sizes were combined to produce an overall mean difference effect size of
   -.85, which indicated that the average difference in performance between
   Black and White girl literacy was almost one standard deviation. The
   second approach summarized the mean differences from 33 effect sizes
   using the previous administration year as the comparison group. A
   statistically significant mean difference of .09 was observed for the
   QuantCrit approach. Our study contributes to the literature on racially
   just epistemologies by providing concurrent analyses of meta-analytic
   data to expose the unique features of QuantCrit that make it distinct
   from traditional approaches to Quantitative research.},

Title = {Language, Comfort Speaking, and Collaboration: A QuantCrit Analysis of

Abstract = {Active learning practices, like groupwork, are becoming more widely used
   in post-secondary mathematics classrooms. These practices are often
   talk-intensive and require interpersonal interactions. As such, it
   remains an open question the extent to which practices like groupwork
   equitably support students with different social identities, including
   identities that center language. The goal of this paper is to use
   critical quantitative methodology to analyze the experiences of students
   in introductory college mathematics courses, particularly in courses
   that require peer collaboration. The data for this paper stems from
   surveys completed by 464 undergraduate students with different language
   backgrounds. The analysis identifies relationships that existed between
   the identities students brought to the classroom and the identities they
   developed in introductory mathematics courses. Using linear regression
   models, the study found that students' comfort speaking during class and
   the language they preferred to do mathematics in were associated with
   practice-linked identities, like sense of belonging among peers.
   Findings also suggest an interaction between these variables and the
   frequency that students engaged in peer collaboration. This study
   contributes to the growing body of literature documenting how students
   with marginalized identities may have differential experiences with
   active learning practices, like groupwork.},

Title = {Critical Quantitative Literacy: An Educational Foundation for Critical
   Quantitative Research},
Journal = {AERA OPEN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Education research has recently seen the emergence of two distinct
   frameworks guiding the application of quantitative methods through a
   more critical and equity-oriented lens. These two frameworks are
   critical quantitative (CritQuant) studies and quantitative critical race
   theory (QuantCrit). Although different in their intellectual traditions,
   they both acknowledge the oppressive history of quantitative methods and
   the need to improve the criticality of quantitative research in
   education. For applied quantitative research in education to become more
   critical, it is imperative that learners of quantitative methodology be
   made aware of its historical and modern misuses. This directive calls
   for an important change in the way quantitative methodology is taught in
   educational classrooms. Critical quantitative literacy (CQL) is
   introduced in this manuscript as a paradigm for teaching, learning,
   understanding, and applying quantitative methods in a way that supports
   the application of CritQuant and QuantCrit frameworks in educational
   research.},

Abstract = {Although the critical research cannon is often associated with
   qualitative scholars, there is a growing number of critical scholars who
   are refusing positivist-informed quantitative analyses. However, as a
   growing number of education scholars engaged in critical approaches to
   quantitative inquiry, instances of conflation began to surface. We
   understood this conflation as the interchangeable use of the terms
   quantitative criticalism, QuantCrit, and critical quantitative
   throughout the literature and even within the same chapter or article.
   The purpose of our systematic literature review is twofold: (a) to
   understand how critical approaches to quantitative inquiry emerged as a
   new paradigm within quantitative methods and (b) whether there is any
   distinction between quantitative criticalism, QuantCrit, and critical
   quantitative inquiries or simply interchangeable wordplay. We share how
   critical quantitative approaches are definite shifts within the
   quantitative research paradigm, highlight relevant assumptions, and
   share strategies and future directions for applied practice in this
   emergent field.},

Title = {Interrogating the Relationship between Racial Activism and Academic
   Career Interest among STEM Doctoral Students},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Purpose: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields
   are not known for producing a high number of racial activists. On the
   contrary, scientific discourse often traffics in race-neutral language
   and ideologies, all the while producing racist science and technologies.
   This research explored the relationship between racial activism and
   academic career intentions of underrepresented and racially minoritized
   (URM) STEM doctoral students. Research Methods/Approach: We surveyed 301
   Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous STEM doctoral
   students and 96 White and Asian STEM doctoral students. We deploy
   QuantCrit as a methodological stance to guide our analysis of the racial
   activism of students and its effect on their interest and intent in
   pursuing a STEM career. Findings: We found that among URM STEM doctoral
   students, racial activism positively predicts the likelihood of pursuing
   careers in academia. After controlling for the other variables in our
   regression models, racial activism was the strongest predictor based on
   standardized beta coefficients. Implications: Recent events have
   reactivated racial activism in academia, highlighting the experiences of
   URM STEM students and faculty. Yet Latinx faculty have increased
   minimally, Indigenous faculty numbers are stagnant, and Black faculty
   numbers in science and engineering are decreasing. Our research suggests
   that URM STEM doctoral students seek out careers in academia to leverage
   their commitment to racial activism by producing racially and culturally
   affirming science and technology for the benefit of society.},
